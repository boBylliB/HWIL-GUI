SWISH = SoftWare Integrated with Solar Hardware
	Simulation With Integrated Solar Hardware

Ursagryph = HWIL = SIMS V0.1 = SIMS Prototype
- Initial design for SIMS, and initial concept
- Good to document as lineage/history
SWISH = SIMS V1.0 = SIMS Initial Release
- First full SIMS design, and first fully working model, feature updates will be V1.1, V1.2, etc.
- Name specifies Solar Hardware as that is really the only major hardware integrated so far
??? = SIMS V2.0 = SIMS Expanded Release
- Next full SIMS design, feature updates will be V2.1, V2.2, etc.
- V1 -> V2 will indicate some kind of major model update or rework, TBD
- Examples may include:
  - New integrated hardware system
  - New entire subsystem added to the integrated software system
  - New satellite system modelled somewhere in the simulation
- The acronym for this should be decided by the engineers who design the major upgrade
  - Obviously way out of my control, but would be cool if this becomes a thing down the line
  - Would be a cool "tradition" to have each major update come with a new acronym
  - This acronym would be chosen either at conception of the full idea or announced with the release
